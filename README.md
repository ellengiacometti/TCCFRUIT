The goal of this project is to recognize and classify Tahiti Lemons.
We used 3 diferent types of artificial intelligence:
	Random Forest
	Neural Network
	SVM
For each method we have created 2 classifiers. The very first identifies whether the lemon is ripe  or unripe. The other identifies whether there is or not defects on the lemon.
